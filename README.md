# Tuplex Factorio Community Server

Pssst! Don't tell Tuplex!

Announcing (but quietly please, lest Tuplex hears):

THE TUPLEX FACTORIO SPACE EXPLORATION AND KRASTORIO 2 (SE+K2) CHALLENGE

This current map is built around the Space Exploration and Krastorio 2 overhaul mods extending Factorio's late game considerably.

This will be a very, very long game (so bring plenty of coffee and cheese puffs)!

With these mods, players can build rockets and travel through space to other planets for resources not found in the vanilla Factorio world of Nauvis. Both mods add numerous items, buildings, and technologies to propel players into the unknown!

You can find the server on the factorio public server listing.
Name : Tuplex Community Server K2+SE
Factorio Version : 1.1.25
Password can be found on Discord
If needed, use the Direct IP connect option using 50.80.157.72:34197 as the IP.
Let your mods and modsettings sync and you should be all set.

In all seriousness, the real goal is to have fun...while being productive...and it's also very important to not let @Tuplex know this is happening.

SE+K2 are quite complex and as such, we need all the help we can get! But we also need to get along in the process so please observe all of the #Community Server rules pinned in this channel.
Additionally, as we expect many of you to help us (PLEASE!), we need an orderly way to make sure to get things done.
Building Projects:
Your team Kaptain will keep a list of projects in the Todo List.
Please, only take on projects from the Todo List.
If you want to do a project, then claim it using the "Take" button...and DON'T TELL Tuplex!!! (we are super serious)
If you want to suggest a project that's not listed, then please feel free to DM @KMack413 either in-game by voice or chat or right here in the discord.
